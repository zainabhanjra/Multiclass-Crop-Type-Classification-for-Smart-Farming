# Multiclass-Crop-Type-Classification-for-Smart-Farming

This project applies machine and statistical learning methods in R to classify 21 crop types using the Smart Farming 2024 dataset (2,200 observations, 23 features). The dataset includes soil nutrients, weather, irrigation, and environmental variables relevant to precision agriculture.

Key highlights:

🔍Performed EDA, preprocessing, and feature engineering in R (tidyverse, caret, glmnet, randomForest, e1071, nnet)

🤖 Trained & compared 7 supervised learning models: Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, KNN, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network

✅ Achieved 99.6% accuracy with Random Forest, the top-performing model

🌱 Identified rainfall, humidity, and potassium as the most influential predictors

📊 Visualized performance with confusion matrices, accuracy plots, and feature importance rankings

This repository demonstrates the integration of statistical rigor and machine learning power in R for smart farming applications, with practical implications for crop monitoring, input optimization, and sustainable agriculture.
